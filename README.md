# G8-WebStore
Simulation of a web store for mobile phones I've built from scratch, as part of the final project while studying Java development at ITAcademy (Belgrade). I used Java (JSP & Servlets) with Hibernate and SQL relational database. Bootstrap v3.3.7 used for front end. Tools used: NetBeans, MySQL Workbench.
